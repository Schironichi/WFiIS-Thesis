# WFiIS-Thesis
VR application made using Unity + VRTK for physics demonstrations.

The aim of the project was to design and implement an application based on VR technology that allows visualization of physics demonstrations. Program is based on a virtual environment in which, by design, a user can present certain aspects of Nature that cannot be seen in reality.

The application is based on the Unity engine with addidtion to [VRTK](https://www.vrtk.io/) library. Everything was developed and tested using Oculus Quest 2 HMD.

There is a release with two versions: PCVR and Quest 2 Standalone. Instructions on how to run the application is in the [release page](https://github.com/Schironichi/WFiIS-Thesis/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
